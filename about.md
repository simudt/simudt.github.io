Hi, Iâ€™m Dogukan Uraz. I'm a dedicated supercomputing researcher with interests in AI supercomputing kernels, hardware-aware computations, sparse training architectures, and scaling mechanisms. My goal is to contribute multimodal foundation models and large world models with newer architectures or scaling mechanisms that can boost future generalist capabilities.

Beyond that, I find joy and beauty in new discoveries and breakthroughs, and my goal is to actively seek ways to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of these fields. Along my journey, I aim to make friends, meaningful contributions, and share my learning notes.

The rest is mere commentary. So, here to join the AGI party!

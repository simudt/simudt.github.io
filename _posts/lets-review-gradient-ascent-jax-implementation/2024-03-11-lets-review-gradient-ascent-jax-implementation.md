In machine learning or artificial intelligence studies, for both, optimization algorithms plays an important role in models to achieve peak performance. Such algorithm that stands out like very well-known gradient descent. This algorithm finds itself a extensive applications in machine learning, especially in situations aimed at optimizing a certain objective function. 

In my Medium blog post, I review that gradient ascent algorithm and its relation with very-well know gradient descent and serving Jax implementation of this algorithm in a packaged way.
